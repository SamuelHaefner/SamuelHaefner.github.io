I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [University of St. Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch). 

My main interests are in industrial organization, particularly contracts, auctions, and contests. 

I also study incentives in blockchain markets and in cryptographic protocols.

I am affiliated with the [Zurich Center for Market Design](https://www.marketdesign.uzh.ch).
