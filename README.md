I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [University of St. Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch). 

I am a microeconomist by training. My main interests are in contract theory, contest theory, and auction theory. I also analyze incentives in blockchain markets and in cryptographic protocols.

I am affiliated with the [Zurich Center for Market Design](https://www.marketdesign.uzh.ch).
